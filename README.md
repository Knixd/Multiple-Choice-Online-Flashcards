# Multiple-Choice-Online-Flashcards
A web browser flashcard system that puts a unique spin on flashcards. Flashcards sets are presented in levels. You'll practice the same set of carsds until you level-up. When you level-up you'll be introduced to new flashcards in addition to old ones. 

But wait, there's more! 

Users gain experience to level up their decks, but holding true to dissipating knowledge, users also lose experience upon incorrect answers. (In theory we can't lose "experience", so I've called experience "confidence", because we can all lose confidence.)

The rate at which users see new cards can also be modified. The default is for users to see new cards more. SRS-type functionality could be added in here instead.

# Multiple-Choice-Online-Flashcards
A web browser flashcard system that puts a unique spin on flashcards. Flashcards sets are presented in levels. You'll practice the same set until you level-up whereupon you'll be introduced to new flashcards in addition to old ones. But wait (!), there's more! Users gain experience to level up their decks, but holding true to dissipating knowledge, users also lose experience upon incorrect answers. In theory we can't lose "experience", so I've called experience "confidence", because we can all lose confidence.
